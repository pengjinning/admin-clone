# Admin Clone

Chrome extension that analyzes admin dashboards, reconstructs their component tree, and exports ready-to-edit source code.

## Features

- One-click analysis of the current admin panel
- Traversal engine that walks menu structures and captures every page
- Code generation targeting React + Ant Design (more stacks coming)
- Popup UI plus persistent Chrome side panel

## Local Installation (Chrome)

1. Download the latest `admin-clone.zip` asset from the repo (generated by `package_and_sync.sh`).
2. Extract the zip; you will see a ready-to-load `dist/` folder inside.
3. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, then click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the extracted `dist/` directory.
5. (Optional) Pin the extension and open the side panel via the puzzle icon → “Admin Clone”.
